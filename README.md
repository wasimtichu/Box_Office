# Box Office Collection Analysis Using SQL <br>

I performed an in-depth analysis of Box Office Collection Data using SQL to extract key insights. The queries focused on movie trends, revenue performance, producer involvement, and release patterns.

Key Analyses Conducted:

1. Identified all movies released in 2020 to analyze trends specific to that year.
2. Retrieved the top 5 highest-grossing movies across all years to determine the most commercially successful films.
3. Listed producers who produced comedy movies in 2019, providing insights into genre-based production trends.
4. Determined the shortest-duration movie released in 2020, helping analyze runtime preferences.
5. Identified the movie with the highest opening weekend collection and checked whether it was the same movie with the highest overall box office revenue.
6. Listed movies where the weekend collection matched the first-week collection, highlighting consistent performance trends.
7. Extracted the top 3 movies with the highest foreign (international) box office collection to assess global market performance.
8. Identified movies released on non-weekend days (Monday to Thursday) to study weekday release strategies.
9. Filtered all non-comedy movies produced by Reliance Entertainment, offering insights into their genre diversity.
10. Listed movies produced in October, November, or December that were released on weekends, analyzing seasonal and strategic release patterns.

This SQL-driven approach provided valuable business insights into movie performance, release strategies, and revenue patterns.
